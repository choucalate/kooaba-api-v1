# kooaba Web Services

The kooaba Web Services offer access to [kooaba](http://www.kooaba.com)'s image recognition platform. The Web Services consist of API's for recognition of query images (Query API) and for uploading reference images to the databases for recognition (Data API).

## Obtaining API access

Note: this version (v1 and and v2-beta) of the API is deprecated.

You can sign up to the latest version (v 4.x) under [http://www.kooaba.com/en/plans_and_pricing](http://www.kooaba.com/en/plans_and_pricing). The documentation for v4 can be found under [http://docs.kooaba.com/](http://docs.kooaba.com/).


## Using the API

Once you obtained your access keys, documentation on using the API's and some sample code are given in the subdirectories of this project.
